      <p>AN ADAPTATION.</p>
      <p>BY ORPHEUS C. KERR.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">CHAPTER XXIV.</p>
      <p>MR. CLEWS AT HIS NOVEL.<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a
 href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
      <p>Thrown into Rembrandtish relief by the light of a garish
kerosene lamp upon the table: with one discouraged lock of hair hanging
over his nose, and straw hat pushed so far back from his phrenological
brow that its vast rim had the fine artistic effect of a huge saintly
nimbus: Mr. BUMSTEAD sat gynmastically crosswise in an easy-chair, over
an arm of which his slender lower limbs limply dangled, and elaborately
performed one of the grander works of BACH upon an irritable accordion.
Now, winking with intense rapidity, and going through the muscular
motions of an excitable person resolutely pulling out an obstinate and
inexplicable drawer from somewhere about his knees, he produced
sustained and mournful notes, as of canine distress in the backyard;
anon, with eyes nearly closed and the straw nimbus sliding still
further back, his manipulation was that of an excessively weary
gentleman slowly compressing a large sponge, thereby squeezing out
certain choking, snorting, guttural sounds, as of a class softly
studying the German language in another room; and, finally, with an
impatient start from the unexpected slumber into which the last shaky <i>pianissimo</i>
had momentarily betrayed him, he caught the untamed instrument in
mid-air, just as it was treacherously getting away from him,
frantically balanced it there for an instant on all his clutching
finger-tips, and had it prisoner again for a renewal of the weird
symphony.</p>
      <p>Seriously offended at the discovery that he could not drop
asleep in his own room, for a minute, without the music stopping and
the accordion trying to slip off, the Ritualistic organist was not at
all softened in temper by almost simultaneously realizing that the
farther skirt of his long linen coat was standing out nearly straight
from his person, and, apparently, fluttering in a heavy draught.</p>
      <p> "Who's-been-ope'nin'-th'-window?" he sternly asked,
"What's-meaning-'f-such-a-gale-at thistime-'f-year?"</p>
      <p>"Do I intrude?" inquired a voice close at hand.</p>
      <p>Looking very carefully along the still extended skirt of his
coat towards exactly the point of the compass from which the voice
seemed to come, Mr. BUMSTEAD at last awoke to the conviction that the
tension of his garment and its breezy agitation were caused by the
tugging of a human figure.</p>
      <p>"Do I intrude?" repeated Mr. TRACEY CLEWS, dropping the skirt
as he spoke. "Have I presumed too greatly in coming to request the
favor of a short private interview?"</p>
      <p>Slipping quickly into a more genteel but rather rigid position
on his chair, the Ritualistic organist made an airy pass at him with
the accordion.</p>
      <p>"Any doors where youwasborn, sir?"</p>
      <p>"There were, Mr. BUMSTEAD."</p>
      <p>"People ever knock when th' wanted t'-come-in, sir?"</p>
      <p>"Why, I did knock at your door," answered Mr. CLEWS,
conciliatingly. "I knocked and knocked, but you kept on playing; and
after I finally took the liberty to come in and pull you by the coat,
it was ten minutes before you found it out."</p>
      <p>In an attempt to look into the speaker's inmost soul, Mr.
BUMSTEAD fell into a doze, from which the crash of his accordion to the
floor aroused him in time to behold a very curious proceeding on the
part of Mr. CLEWS. That gentleman successively peered up the chimney,
through the windows, and under the furniture of the room, and then
stealthily took a seat near his rather languid observer.</p>
      <p>"Mr. BUMSTEAD, you know me as a temporary boarder under the
same roof with you. Other people know me merely as a dead-beat. May I
trust you with a secret?"</p>
      <p>A pair of blurred and glassy eyes looked into his from under a
huge straw hat, and a husky question followed his:</p>
      <p>"Did y' ever read WORDSWORTH'S poem-'f-th' Excursion, sir?"</p>
      <p>"Not that I remember."</p>
      <p>"Then, sir," exclaimed the organist, with spasmodic
animation&#8212;"then's not in your hicsperience to know howssleepy-I
am-jus'-now."</p>
      <p>"You had a nephew," said his subtle companion, raising his
voice, and not appearing to heed the last remark.</p>
      <p>"An' 'numbrella," added Mr. BUMSTEAD, feebly.</p>
      <p>"I say you had a nephew," reiterated the other, "and that
nephew disappeared in a very mysterious manner. Now I'm a literary man&#8212;"</p>
      <p>"C'd tell that by y'r-headerhair," murmured the Ritualistic
organist. Left y'r wife yet, sir?"</p>
      <p>"I say I'm a literary man," persisted TRACEY CLEWS, sharply.
"I'm going to write a great American Novel, called 'The Amateur
Detective,' founded upon the story of this very EDWIN DROOD, and have
come to Bumsteadville to get all the particulars. I've picked up
considerable from Gospeler SIMPSON, JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, and even the woman
from the Mulberry street place who came after you the other morning.
But now I want to know something from you.&#8212;What has become of your
nephew?"</p>
      <p>He put the question suddenly, and with a kind of suppressed
leap at him whom he addressed. Immeasurable was his surprise at the
perfectly calm answer&#8212;</p>
      <p>"I can't r'member hicsactly, sir."</p>
      <p>"Can't remember!&#8212;Can't remember what?"</p>
      <p>"Where-I-put't."</p>
      <p>"<i>It?</i>"</p>
      <p>"Yes. Th' umbrella."</p>
      <p>"What on earth are you talking about?" exclaimed Mr. CLEWS, in
a rage. "&#8212;Come! Wake up!&#8212;What have umbrellas to do with this?"</p>
      <p>Rousing himself to something like temporary consciousness, Mr.
BUMSTEAD slowly climbed to his feet, and, with a wild kind of swoop,
came heavily down with both hands upon the shoulders of his questioner.</p>
      <p>"What now?" asked that startled personage.</p>
      <p>"You want t' know 'bout th' umbrella?" said BUMSTEAD, with
straw hat amazingly awry, and linen coat a perfect map of creases.</p>
      <p>"Yes!&#8212;You're crushing me!" panted Mr. CLEWS.</p>
      <p>"Th' umbrella!" cried Mr. BUMSTEAD, suddenly withdrawing his
hands and swaying before his visitor like a linen person on
springs&#8212;"This's what there's 'bout 't: <i>Where th' umbrella is, there
is Edwin also!</i>"</p>
      <p>Astounded by, this bewildering confession, and fearful that
the uncle of Mr. DROOD would be back in his chair and asleep again if
he gave him a chance, the excited inquisitor sprang from his chair, and
slowly and carefully backed the wildly glaring object of his
solicitation until his shoulders and elbows were safely braced against
the mantel-piece. Then, like one inspired, he grasped a bottle of soda
water from the table, and forced the reviving liquid down his staring
patient's throat; as quickly tore off his straw hat, newly moistened
the damp sponge in it at a neighboring washstand, and replaced both on
the aching head; and, finally, placed in one of his tremulous hands a
few cloves from a saucer on the mantel-shelf.</p>
      <p>"You are better now? You can tell me more?" he said, resting a
moment from his violent exertions.</p>
      <p>With the unsettled air of one coming out of a complicated
dream, Mr. BUMSTEAD chewed the cloves musingly; then, after nodding
excessively, with a hideous smile upon his countenance, suddenly threw
an arm about the neck of his restorer and wept loudly upon his bosom.</p>
      <p>"My fr'en'," he wailed, in a damp voice, "lemme confess to
you. I'm a mis'able man, my fr'en'; perfectly mis'able. These
cloves&#8212;these insidious tropical spices&#8212;have been thebaneofmyexistence.
On Chrishm's night&#8212;<i>that</i> Chrishm's night&#8212;I toogtoomany.
Wha'scons'q'nce? I put m' nephew an' m' umbrella away somewhere, an 've
neverb'n able terremembersince!"</p>
      <p>Still sustaining his weight, the author of "The Amateur
Detective" at first seemed nonplussed; but quickly changed his
expression to one of abrupt intelligence.</p>
      <p>"I see, now; I begin to see," he answered, slowly, and almost
in a whisper. "On the night of that Christmas dinner here, you were in
a clove-trance, and made some secret disposition, (which you have not
since been able to remember,) of your umbrella&#8212;and nephew. Until very
lately&#8212;until now, when you are nearly, but <i>not quite</i>, as much
under the influence of cloves again&#8212;you have had a vague general idea
that somebody else must have killed Mr. DROOD and stolen your umbrella.
But now, that you are partially in the same condition, physiologically
and psychologically, as on the night of the disappearance, you have
once more a partial perception of what were the facts of the case. Am I
right?"</p>
      <p>"That's it, sir. You're a ph'los'pher," murmured Mr. BUMSTEAD,
trying to brush from above his nose the pendent lock of hair, which he
took for a fly.</p>
      <p>"Very well, then," continued TRACEY CLEWS, his extraordinary
head of hair fairly bristling with electrical animation: "You've only
to get yourself into <i>exactly the same</i> clove-y condition as on
the night of the double disappearance, when you put your umbrella and
nephew away somewhere, and you'll remember all about it again. You have
two distinct states of existence, you see: a cloven one, and an
uncloven one; and what you have done in one you are totally oblivious
of in the other."</p>
      <p>Something like an occult wink trembled for a moment in the
right eye of Mr. BUMSTEAD.</p>
      <p>"Tha's ver' true," said he, thoughtfully. "I've been 'blivious
m'self, frequently. Never c'd r'member wharIowed."</p>
      <p>"The idea I've suggested to you for the solution of this
mystery," went on Mr. CLEWS, "Is expressed by one of the greatest of
English writers; who, in his very last work, says; '&#8212;in some cases of
drunkenness, and in others of animal magnetism, there are two states of
consciousness which never clash, but each of which pursues its separate
course as though it were continuous instead of broken. Thus, if I hide
my watch when I am drunk, I must be drunk again before I can remember
where.'<a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>"</p>
      <p>"I'm norradrink'n'man, sir," returned Mr. BUMSTEAD, drawing
coldly back from him, and escaping a fall into the fireplace by a
dexterous surge into the nearest chair. "Th' lemon tea which I take for
my cold, or to pr'vent the cloves from disagreeing with me, is
norrintoxicating."</p>
      <p>"Of course not," assented his subtle counsellor; "but, in this
country, at least, chronic inebriation, clove-eating, and even
opium-taking, are strikingly alike in their aspects, and the same rules
may be safely applied to all. My advice to you is what I have given.
Cause a table to be spread in this room, exactly as it was for that
memorable Christmas-dinner; sit down to it exactly as then, and at the
same hour; go through all the same processes as nearly as you can
remember; and, by the mere force of association, you will enact all the
final performances with your umbrella and your nephew."</p>
      <p>Mr. BUMSTEAD'S arms were folded tightly across his manly
breast, and the fine head with the straw hat upon it tilted heavily
towards his bosom.</p>
      <p>"I see't now," said he softly; "bone han'le 'n ferule. I
r'member threshing 'm with it. I can r'memb'r carry'ng&#8212;" Here Mr.
BUMSTEAD burst into tears, and made a frenzied dash at the lock of hair
which he again mistook for a fly.</p>
      <p>"To sum up all," concluded Mr. TRACEY CLEWS, shaking him
violently by the shoulder, that he might remain awake long enough to
hear it,&#8212;"to sum up all, I am satisfied, from the familiar knowledge of
this mystery I have already gained, that the end will have something to
do with exercise in the Open Air! You'll have to go outdoors for
something important. And now good night."</p>
      <p>"Goornight, sir."</p>
      <p>Retiring softly to his own room, under the same roof, the
author of "The Amateur Detective" smiled at himself before the mirror
with marked complacency. "You're a long-headed one, my dead-beat
friend," he said, archly, "and your great American Novel is likely to
be a respectable success."</p>
      <p>There sounded a crash upon a floor, somewhere in the house,
and he held his breath to listen. It was the Ritualistic organist going
to bed.</p>

      <p>The Farthing Candle of New York journalism appears to be
trying to find what political party he can best bully into offering the
largest reward for his conscientious support. As a looker on,
PUNCHINELLO would suggest to the political parties, as applicable in

      <p><b>SOME TRAITS OF THE CHINESE.</b></p>
      <p><img src="images/52.jpg" align="left" alt="O">f all human
races, next to the monkies, the Mongolians are the most imitative. They
are only a little lower than the monkies in this respect, and we have
seen some trained ones that could successfully compete with the Simians
on their own ground.</p>
      <p>A Chinaman employed in the North Adams shoe factory, for
instance, was asked to imitate exactly a boot of a particular style,
which was shown to him. After a few trials, he imitated the boot so
perfectly, that a customer who came in took him to be the fellow of it,
and was not undeceived until he went to try him on. No wonder that the
regular Crispins are jealous of a foreign cordwainer who can do this.</p>
      <p>In the art of dress-making for ladies the Chinese display
wonderful skill. Their taste and inventiveness in this branch are
unrivalled even by the best French <i>modistes</i>. The <i>panier</i>
with which it pleases the ladies of the period to protuberate their
persons was of Chinese origin. It was revealed in an opium dream to a
celebrated male mantua-maker of Pekin, who sold the idea to a
Yankee-Notions man travelling in China for a Paris house. The inventor
was so chagrined at hearing afterwards of the immense fortune realized
from it by the man of the West, that he committed suicide by hanging
himself on a willow-pattern plate.</p>
      <p>Although the Chinaman does not naturally possess an ear for
music, according to our standard, yet his imitative power enables him
to adapt himself very readily to the production of melody. One of the
Coolies employed in the great HERVEY wash-house at South Belleville,
N.J., was observed to watch with great interest an itinerant performer
on the accordion. Shortly afterwards, catching up a sucking-pig by the
tail and snout, he manipulated it precisely as the player did the
accordion, producing&#8212;accordion to the testimony of several credible
witnesses,&#8212;strains quite as good as, if not worse than, those drawn out
by that musician.</p>
      <p>As soon as the 200,000 Chinamen ordered by Mynheer
KOOPMAN-SCHOOP arrive in this country, a good business can be driven by
Yankee toothpick makers in supplying them with chopsticks. This word
was originally "stop-chick," being so called from the use occasionally
made of it by Chinamen for knocking down young poultry. It became
corrupted, like everything that is good and pure, by contact with
extreme civilization. Anybody who can make a shoe-peg or wooden
toothpick can make a chopstick. It is to be hoped that the chopstick
may ultimately be adopted here instead of the knife and fork. It would
preclude the possibility of people carrying their food into their
mouths with the knife&#8212;an outrage so commonly to be remarked at hotel
tables.</p>
      <p>A very intelligent Chinaman told the writer, not long since,
that there is absolutely nothing to be seen or heard of in this country
that the Chinese were not familiar with several thousand years ago.
Among them he enumerated target-companies, sewing-machines, patent
baby-jumpers, nitro-glycerine, shoo-fly chewing-tobacco, wooden hams,
stuffed ballot-boxes, and a hundred other things which we are prone to
brag of as being purely Yankee and original. We are too conceited about
ourselves, by a great deal, and it is good for us that even Chinese
shoemakers should come here once in a while, to "take us out of our
boots."</p>

      <p><img src="images/54.jpg" align="left" alt="S">olemn and severe
German tragedy reigns in the Fourteenth Street theatre. Once it was
called the French theatre, and was devoted to the witty comedies of
SCRIBE, and the luxurious legs of OFFENBACH. But a woe has been
denounced against the SCRIBES and OFFENBACHS&#8212;(there is considerable
difference between the latter and the Pharisees)&#8212;of that once gay
theatre. Like many other French frivolities, it has lately yielded to
Teutonic tragedy. The cold and calculating German "MEPHISTOPHELES"
treads the stage where once tripped the light feet of Parisian beauty.
The burlesque Germans of the Grand Duchy of Gerolstein have vanished
before the grim and earnest countrymen of grand and simple old King
WILLIAM. It will be long before the French players find heart to
burlesque anew the German soldiery. It will be some time, let us hope,
before the German players at the Fourteenth Street theatre give way to
the shameless antics of French Opera-Bouffe buffoons.</p>
      <p>PUNCHINELLO gives a glad farewell&#8212;with no thought of saying <i>au
revoir</i>&#8212;to the French follies that have given the French theatre so
unenviable a reputation; and he waves his pointed hat in joyful welcome
to SEEBACH and her German friends who have made the Fourteenth Street
theatre a temple of the classic drama. Like other places which can
properly be called dramatic temples, the theatre now partakes of the
solemnity of a religious temple. One goes to see SEEBACH, not to laugh,
but to test one's ability to suppress the desire to weep over the woes
of MARGARET, and to mourn with MARY STUART. Fortify yourself, O reader,
with a substantial dinner and much previous sleep, and come with me for
a night of German tragedy. Come to the Fourteenth Street theatre, not
to look back regretfully at departed opera-bouffe, but to SEEBACH. It
is with such reckless puns as the foregoing, that I endeavor to brace
your spirits for the exhausting struggle with six hours of tragedy
played in the most tragic and awful of modern languages. You are to
hear <i>Faust</i> in German. No man who has accomplished this feat can
wonder at the stolid bravery of the German infantry. It is said that
the new recruit is forced to hear <i>Faust</i> once a week during his
first year of service. This terrible discipline has the natural effect
of giving him that steadiness under fire, at which the world marvels.
He will stand with his regiment for hours under the merciless fire of
the mitrailleuse with no thought of flight. What terrors can shot or
shell have for him who has been taught to listen unmoved to the
dialogue of "FAUST" and "MEPHISTOPHELES" in the first thirty-two acts
of <i>Faust</i>?</p>
      <p>We find the theatre full of Germans, wearing that grave and
earnest expression of countenance wherewith the German takes his
legitimate tragedy. Sprinkled among the Germans are several Americans,
more grave and more in earnest than even their Teutonic neighbors, for
they are straining their attention to detect a familiar German
word&#8212;such as "Mein Herr," or "Ach." When once they have heard the
expected syllables, they smile a placid smile of contentment, and
remark, one to another, "I can understand pretty nearly everything that
is said,&#8212;with the exception, of course, of an occasional word."</p>
      <p>We take our seats and wait for the entrance of SEEBACH. The
curtain rises upon "FAUST" pursuing his studies in middle-age,
respectability, and a dressing-gown. To him, after hours of soliloquy,
enters "MEPHISTOPHELES." We observe, with surprise, that those
estimable gentlemen, Col. THOMAS W. KNOX and Hon. ERASTUS BROOKS, have
been engaged to play "FAUST" and "MEPHISTOPHELES" respectively, To be
sure the programme informs us that these parts are taken by two newly
imported German actors, but we prefer the evidence of our senses to the
assertions of the programme. Have KNOX and BROOKS been copied in
German? If not, they are now playing in Fourteenth Street. Don't tell
me that it is merely an accidental resemblance. Haven't I played
billiards with the gallant COLONEL, and gone to sleep when the
Honorable EDITOR was speaking in Congress? And shall I now be told that
I don't know them when I see them? But this is irrelevant.</p>
      <p>Hours of dialogue succeed to the previous hours of soliloquy.
At intervals of fifteen minutes the curtain is dropped to enable the
actors to discuss mugs of beer and the audience to discuss the actors.
During these intervals we hear such remarks as these:</p>
      <p>1ST GERMAN. "Subjectively considered, <i>Faust</i> is a
tragedy. Objectively, we might regard it as a comedy. To the
subjective-objective view, it is certainly a ballet pantomime. Ach! he
was many-sided, our GOETHE. Here in this drama he has accomplished
everything. There is food for our laughter and our tears. It excites us
and calms us."</p>
      <p>1ST AMERICAN. "I should think it did calm us. That's why the
old fellow went to sleep and snored all through the last twelve acts. I
think it's the heaviest and stupidest play that was ever put on the
stage. Of course it's the greatest thing ever written, but then I
prefer DALY'S <i>Gaslight</i>, myself."</p>
      <p>2ND GERMAN. "Ah, my friend, how this sublime creation stirs
the inner depths of our spiritual natures. Ach, Himmel! it is the poem
of Humanity. Let us go out for beer."</p>
      <p>2D AMERICAN. "When are we going to see SEEBACH?"</p>
      <p>USHER. "She don't appear until the twenty-third act, sir. That
will be on about three hours from now."</p>
      <p>2D AMERICAN. "Come, TOM, let's go and have supper. I am
getting exhausted."</p>
      <p>USHER. "Step this way, sir. Mr. GRAU has some refreshments at
your service."</p>
      <p>And they go in search of the cold ham and beer which the
beneficent GRAU has kindly provided. Refreshed by much beer, and
enlivened by the cheery influence of the genial sandwich, they return
for a few more hours of soliloquy and dialogue.</p>
      <p>Time passes slowly, but surely. At last we reach an act in
which SEEBACH walks quietly across the stage. The curtain instantly
drops amid the sobs of the excited audience.</p>
      <p>1ST GERMAN. "Lend me your handkerchief, my friend, that I may
wipe away my tears. I have a sausage wrapped up in mine, but what are
sausages compared with art! How divinely SEEBACH walks. To me, she
seems like an incarnation of Pure Reason, an Avatar of the spirit of
transcendental philosophy. Come, we will pledge her in beer."</p>
      <p>1ST AMERICAN. "What are they making all that row about&#8212;just
because SEEBACH walked across the stage? Why, she never said a word."</p>
      <p>2D AMERICAN. "Let's go round to the hotel and take a quiet
sleep till she comes on again. I've got my night-clothes with me.
Always bring 'em when I go to see German tragedy."</p>
      <p>Then ensue other hours of dialogue, interspersed with
soliloquies of half an hour each. Interspersed also with perpetual
dropping of the curtain, whereby the play is made to last some eight or
ten hours longer than would otherwise be the case. Most of the German
music that has been written during the last three centuries is played
by the orchestra during these intermissions. But in course of time
SEEBACH gives us the Garden scene, winning our frantic admiration by
her inimitable tenderness and grace, and finally we reach that grandest
scene ever written by dramatist, that most pathetic poem ever conceived
by poet&#8212;the meeting of "FAUST" and "MARGARET" in prison. At last we are
more than repaid for the dreary hours that have gone before. We have
seen SEEBACH'S "MARGARET"&#8212;the most powerful, the most pathetic, the
most beautiful, the most perfect creation of the stage.</p>
      <p>And as we pass slowly up the tortuous, steep stairways of the
theatre, while the Germans, all talking at once, burden the air with
unintelligible gutturals, you say to me&#8212;if you are the intelligent
person that you ought to be&#8212;"SEEBACH is the greatest actress of this
century&#8212;greater than RISTORI, subtler and more tender than RACHEL."</p>
      <p>With which opinion the undersigned concurs with all the
emphasis of conviction; and over our late breakfast, to which we
immediately sit down, we discuss the question, Which is the
greatest&#8212;the poet who drew "MARGARET," or the actress who made the
poet's picture warm with passionate life?</p>
      <p>MATADOR.</p>

      <hr style="width: 45%;"> <br>
      <p><b>Absolutely True.</b></p>
      <p>For the last fifty years or so the metaphysical thinkers of
Germany have been engaged in seeking for the Absolute. From present
indications it would seem as though they are about to find it&#8212;where

aided and abetted by Count VON BISMARCK.</p>

go very for wrong. But mark the <i>denouement</i>. Every party
imagines itself the right party, and welcomes him joyfully to its
bosom. Republicans love him, Independents worship him, while Democrats
would endure even the Fifteenth Amendment for his sake. In order to
reciprocate their sentiments Mr. P. would have to resolve himself into
a kind of Demo-Independent-Republican, which he has no idea of doing.
Here's what some of the "organs" say of him:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><big><i>The Sun</i>.</big></p>
      <p>"We hail with joy the accession of PUNCHINELLO to the ranks of
independent journalism as embodied in the <i>Sun</i>, with a
circulation of over 100,000, CHAS. B. DANA Editor, price two cents.
Reinforced by this powerful journal, we shall continue with renewed
vigor to demand of HORACE GREELEY his reasons why J.C. BANCROFT DAVIS
should not be removed from the Assistant Secretaryship of State. We
shall persevere in our attempts to make Gen. GRANT understand that to
move four and a half inches from the White House is an infraction of
the Constitution. Regardless of the tears of the thousands of
advertisers who carry their announcements to our office, we shall
devote our entire space to the vilifying of BORIE, FISH, the <i>Disreputable
Times and False Reporting Tribune</i>. Those elaborate attacks upon
moral corruption and the Erie Ring, for which we have become famous,
will remain specialties with us. All this by PUNCHINELLO'S aid. Bully
for PUNCHINELLO."</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><big><i>The Tribune</i>.</big></p>
      <p>"The moral influence of this paper, which retains the only
correspondent at the seat of war, and whose dispatches, procured at a
cost of over $2,000,000, are copied by the <i>Herald</i>, <i>Sun</i>
and <i>World</i>,&#8212;(and whoever denies it lies damnably, with intent to
malign, etc.,)&#8212;the moral influence of this paper is rapidly extending
itself throughout the country. As a late instance, we note that
PUNCHINELLO has given in its adhesion to the only true and pure
republican agricultural party, which it appropriately names the "Right
Party." PUNCHINELLO was once a frivolous, good-for-nothing sheet,
devoted to low jokes and witticisms. The conversion of its editor to
the temperance cause is the reason of the recent change in its tenets.
We bid it God speed."</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><big><i>The World</i>.</big></p>
      <p>"As the irrefutable and all-enduring truths of Democracy
receive exemplification in contemporaneous events, the reflecting and
refined masses of this city purchase the <i>World</i> in preference to
that decrepit and fast decaying sheet, the <i>Herald</i>. PUNCHINELLO,
recognizing with ethereal foresight the exigencies of the situation,
proclaims itself for the "Right Party"&#8212;our party. We welcome with
acclamation this valuable addition to the Democratic ranks."</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><big><i>The Star</i>.</big></p>

means the <i>Star</i>, whose circulation last Sunday exceeded 375,005

Peruvians, as expounded by the first CAESAR.</p>
      <p>"PUNCHINELLO will prove a pillar of strength to Tammany Hall,

lager-bier, as set forth in 'Boiled for her Bones' and other tales by

unhappy result of organizing plans for American Comic Papers. All is
joy and peace with him now, however; he looks hopefully forward to the
time when PUNCHINELLO shall have attained to his legitimate rank of the

      <p><b>"ONE MORE UNFORTUNATE."</b></p>
      <p>MR. PUNCHINELLO: I fancy myself a victim of imposition, and I
wish to place my case before you. Having, for a period of six months,
"honorably and persistently," (to use the language of my friends,) held
the office of third Deputy-Assistant Register of Caramels, in and for
the city and county of New York, my associates in office and my friends
in general have determined to present me with a testimonial of their
distinguished regards. Accordingly, they have ordered a massive and
handsomely engraved pair of silver tongs, and a splendid silver
fire-shovel. This is all very well, so far, but the committee informed
me yesterday that the shovel and tongs would cost four hundred and
twenty-five dollars, and that, as only eight dollars and a half had
been collected, it was considered highly important that I should
immediately hand over the balance of the price, in order that the
presentation and banquet, (to take place at my house on next Saturday
evening,) might not be postponed, to the great disappointment of my
associates in office and my friends in general.</p>
      <p>Now, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, is not this a little hard on me? I know
very well that it is customary for the recipients of testimonials to
pay three-quarters of the cost of the present, and I am perfectly
willing to abide by this custom; but forty-nine fiftieths is, I think,
rather too heavy, especially as my house is heated by a furnace in the
cellar and I have no use for a shovel and tongs&#8212;particularly silver
ones.</p>
      <p>Yours perturbedly, A. DOANE KNEA.</p>

      <p><b>SALVATION FOR EUROPE</b>.</p>
      <p>Some hope that the great Powers of Europe may yet be saved
from a fate similar to that of the Kilkenny Cats, is to be found in the
fact that General BURNSIDE, favorably known in Rhode Island, is making
arrangements for bringing about peace between France and Germany. It
has already been said by journalists of mark, that, unless Providence
interfered, and that soon, all Europe would shortly be deluged with the
blood of her peoples. General BURNSIDE is the direct representative of
Providence, and he has gone specially to Europe to interfere. He was
born in Providence, (R.I.); he believes in Providence; his portrait is
the special pride of Providence; and there is a "Providence that shapes
his ends." Thus it will be seen that BURNSIDE is the very man for the
situation. It may be asked, (there are cavillers who ask impertinent
questions about everything,) what business BURNSIDE has to meddle with
European affairs? Pshaw!&#8212;one might as well ask what business Colorado
JEWETT has to meddle with everybody's affairs, or GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN,
or PAUL PRY, or WIKOFF. BURNSIDE against BISMARCK for diplomacy any
time. Probably he aims at the throne of France for himself, and having
Providence (R.I.,) to back him, he may sit on it yet.</p>

off their cote and vest and struck a beligerent attitood, at Bosting, a
few days since.</p>
      <p>Yes, sir! I was there, and I still live to tell my tale.</p>
      <p>E-x-z-a-ckt-ly!</p>
      <p>As usual, on all such occasions, the women wore the
bre-b-bifurcated garments, while the <i>softer</i> sex shone
transparently, in silk, satins, and black and bloo spots.</p>
      <p>Like jumpin' jacks, they danced when the <i>strong-minded</i>
pulled the strings, while their ears were pinned back and greased,
ready to be swallered at a minnit's warnin'.</p>
      <p>JEWLEIR WARD HOW was chosen President, and S.E. Sewell, ABBI
KELLY FOSTIR, MARY E. SARGINT, the Rev. J. Freman Klark, LIDIA MARIAR
CHILDE and Frank B. Sanborne, Vice Presidents.</p>
      <p>THE REV. HON. JUDGE AGUSTY J. CHAPIN, ESQ., L.L.D., opened the
dance with a prologue.</p>
      <p>Mrs. How then rose and got up, and said:</p>
      <p>"Feller citizens: We've got together, as usual, without any
plan of operation, except to howl and make faces at the critter man,
ontil he is ready to give up his liberties and endow us <i>angelic</i>
beeins with the privilege of fillin' up with benzine on eleckshun day;
to vote and rool the destinies of the land." (Cheers.)</p>
      <p>"No woman who desires the ballit, shall desist from hen-peckin
her husband, ontil, in his agony, he cries: 'Peace! be still! there's
my harness, get into it.'"</p>
      <p>Mrs. LIVERMOOR, H.B. Blackwell, MARGARET CAMBELL, M. Fiske,
and SARY E. WILKINS, committee on resolutions, reported the follerin:</p>
      <p><i>Whereas:</i> When our anshient relative, Adam, had the
monopoly of the ballit box, it was diskivered that it was not ment for
man to vote alone, and enjoy too much of a good thing. Consekently EVE
was sent to stir him up.</p>
      <p><i>Whereas:</i> When Mother EVE got there, she made it
slightly warm for Adam, by assertin' her rites. Like many of our
members, she made Adam "walk chalk." On eleckshun day she took him by
the ear and walked him to the poles, and for the first time in his life
he voted the woman's rites ticket, and Mr. SATIN was elected by a
unanimous vote.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we recognize in EVE the pioneer of woman's rites,
with ST. NICKOLAS as our patron saint. (Great applause, with "3 cheers
for OLD NICK, the first candidate elected by femail suffrage.")</p>
      <p>It was then resolved to send committees to the Democratic and
Republican conventions, to see if any LOONATICS had been nominated, who
were in favor of femail soopremiosity.</p>
      <p>If any such persons were found, they should be requested to
announce it through the columns of the <i>Woman's Journal</i>, and let
the world know the fools wasent all dead yet.</p>
      <p>Should the candidates be opposed to our cause, it was
recommended that when the Woman's Convention Committee meet, on the
18th of October, that ten talented talkers be appointed to surround the
candidates and talk them to death as a warnin to futer candidates.</p>
      <p>Congratulatory speeches, endorsin' these last resolutions, was
made by the wimmen, and I gess they would have kept talkin' ontil
doomsday, if the chokin-off committee hadn't been sent around with
copies of <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, full of pictures of the new fall
fashions. (Between you and I, Mister PUNCHINELLO, the only thing which
our wives goes heavier on than their rites, so called, is fashions.)
The convention then thanked Hon. Hank Wilson for blowin' their trumpet,
and voted to present him with a new hoop skirt and a pound of spruce
gum as a token of their appreciation.</p>
      <p>Charles Sumner was then trotted, out, viz.:</p>
      <p><i>Whereas:</i> Charles Sumner has, somehow or other, got one
foot kerslop on our platform;</p>
      <p><i>Whereas:</i> He must go the hul hog or none;</p>
      <p><i>Be it resolved:</i> We can't take any stock in Charly,
ontil he wears his hair parted in the middle and done up in a
waterfall, pledgin' himself to go his entire length, next winter, for
the 16th Commendment. (Enthusiastic applause. Cries of "them's um!"
"Kor-rect!" "Selah!'" etc.; "Bully boy with the glass eye!" etc., etc.)</p>
      <p>Mrs. How then got up and said thusly: "My friends: I'me down
onto colleges like a 1000 of brick. They are the mad puddles of
artificial ignorance. If a red-headed woman was alowed to shed her
lite, the proffessors would be throwed into the shades rite lively. The
result would be, the blind would lead the near-sited by the nose.
Them's my sentiments."</p>
      <p>Stephen L. Fostir got up and said:</p>
      <p>"He woulden't go to the poles on eleckshun without his wife as
his ekal a hangin' on his arm."</p>
      <p>Mrs. LIVERMORE sprung quickly to her feet and said: "She'd bet
$4.00 if she was Steve's wife, he'd go to the poles under diffikilties,
then, for she wasen't the woman who thought the man lived that was the
ekal of any woman; and that hain't all," said she. "When we get hold of
the ballit, man has got to get up early in the mornin' to fool <i>us</i>
much. All the koketting with the Democrats, Republicans,
Prohibitionists, and Labor Reformers in the offis of the <i>Woman's
Journal</i>, last summer, don't amount to shucks. Prominent politicians
had entreeted her to go slow and not mash things. I can only say," said
Mrs. L., "as John Bunyan once said:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">'When
woman will, she will.</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And you can jest bet on't;</span><br>

      <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And there's an end on't.'"</span>
      </div>
      <p>An aged individual named Jenking, from Andover, said: "When he
was in his first childhood, he was drest in peticotes. He was now over
75 years old, and believed an old man would feel better in caliker than
satinett. Hereafter they could count on him to wear out their old
dresses."</p>
      <p>A few left-handed compliments were paid to Wendil Fillips, and
altho' Wendil had allers went heavy on Wimmen's Rites, his bein'
endossed by his own sex was a squelcher on him. He wasen't endossed,
but, like Jonah, went overboard, to be hove up agin onto dry land in a
few days, for a whale has got to have a pretty good stomack to keep
Mister Fillips down a great while. That's so.</p>
      <p>A few more resolutions were then voted, but as the Mayor of
Bosting had sent lots of perlicemen there, I didn't heer of any men

      <p><b>SARSFIELD YOUNG ATTENDS A COUNTY FAIR</b>.</p>
      <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO: From early ages, man has been a tiller of
the soil. My ancestors were pretty much all in this line of business.
My venerable great-grandfather-in-law came over in the Mayflower, and
though not exactly a tiller himself, he is supposed to have had a good
deal to do with the tiller department of that historic ship. Several of
our folks have, from time to time, studied agriculture on New England
town farms; which explains the passion I always had for such attractive
out-of-door sports as stump-pulling, laying stone wall, and drinking
very hard cider in the shade.</p>
      <p>Being down at my uncle's this week, I have attended the Annual
County Agricultural Fair. The managers wanted me to go on one of the
committees, (whether it was plain Durhams, or short-horn needle-work, I
don't this moment remember,) but I declined. I told them that, while I
was ready to fill any vacancy that might occur in the "Committee on
Bills upon their Second Reading," they really must excuse me elsewhere.
I finally compromised by accepting a free pass, and agreeing to poke
the ribs of all the cattle I could reach, just as though I was a <i>bona
fide</i> official.</p>
      <p>The show began yesterday with a grand concourse of all the
farming people for miles around. Every farmer brought a pair of hands
with him. The teams were innumerable; I had no idea it was such a
teeming population. There was a procession of yokes of oxen, a brass
band, the living skeleton, two fire engines, citizens generally, the
Orator of the Day, more oxen, marshals in cowhide boots and badges, and
a cavalcade. There may have been other oxen. I did not intend to omit
them.</p>
      <p>The Orator was announced in the bills as "a finished speaker."
He managed to get himself so thoroughly mixed up with his subject,
however, and knew so much about farming, which he was willing to
disclose, that I soon saw he couldn't be safely set down as finished
till late in the afternoon. I don't recall much of his address, further
than that, when he got to talking about Fall Ploughing, he said: "In
the hour of his country's peril, if fall he must, he would a little
rather fall ploughing, than in any other way!" I think, too, he spoke
of the Fates always smiling upon the farmer who improved his soil. I
suppose he meant the phosphates.</p>
      <p>To-day I have been all around the cattle pens. I never saw
such stock before. Owing to their habit of staying out in the country
the year round, they have a firm, sleek, animated look which the best
guaranteed city stock fails to attain. One cow, from her impartial
method of hoisting visitors out of her pasture, was labelled "The
General Hooker."</p>
      <p>There was a fine display of Dorking lambs and Jersey hens,
while some bees of the Berkshire breed fairly divided the honors with a
few very choice Merino pigs. A handsomely built North Devon chain-pump
attracted much attention from the milkmen.</p>
      <p>The turkeys, geese, ducks, poultry and other farm yard <i>habitu&eacute;s</i>,
though cooped up in one corner, did all they could to make the show a
success.</p>
      <p>The products of the soil were heaped up in the richest
profusion. This is a great raising county. No community raised their
quota of substitutes more rapidly, during the war. Rows upon rows of
corn, of barley, rye and oats [like most modern Serials,] seemed as
though they would never come to an end.</p>
      <p>Some early squashes were pointed out to me. I understood that
they were gathered at four o'clock in the morning. This is nothing. I
distinctly remember picking up watermelons, when a schoolboy, much
earlier than that.</p>
      <p>The butter, cheese, and bed quilts, were all of the finest
texture. Everybody took a first premium.</p>
      <p>Among the newly patented inventions I noticed "The JOHN
MORRISSEY Smasher," "The Swamp Angel Sheller," and a lovely piece of
mechanism called "The Just One Mower."</p>
      <p>There was the usual horse trotting from morning to night, both
days, with pool selling, from which, I presume, agriculture derived
great benefit.</p>
      <p>I say nothing of the other side-shows, for (with the exception
of ALEXIS ST. MARTIN,) I never heard of one that was worth going across
the street to see.</p>
      <p>Yours truly, and yours rurally,</p>

      <p><b>OUR PORTFOLIO.</b></p>
      <p>PARIS, THIRD WEEK OF THE REPUBLIC, 1870.</p>
      <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO: I concluded I would leave Paris for Tours
last week, as the refusal of Life Insurance Companies to take war risks
made me apprehensive for the temporal welfare of the youthful TINTOS in
case I should be untimely called hence. It was a wise resolution, but a
few trifling obstacles, to which I shall refer, prevented me from
carrying it out.</p>
      <p>WASHBURNE advised me, as the safest means of escape, to adopt
the character of an American tourist, with which disguise he thought
the Gallic cast of my features would not materially interfere. I took
the hint, and, assuming my scrip and staff, set forth by way of the
Neuilly gate towards Courbevoie. It was after nightfall when I reached
the bridge that crosses the Seine in that neighborhood. A <i>garde
mobile</i> was pacing over the crest of the slight acclivity that rises
near its eastern extremity.</p>
      <p>As I approached he came to a halt, and challenged me sharply.</p>
      <p><i>"Qui va l&agrave;?"</i></p>
      <p><i>"C'est moi,"</i> I answered, (with a very decent accent
which I had cultivated by the daily use of a mild decoction of
alum-water&#8212;an application which I can cordially recommend to Americans
who do not naturally possess that peculiar "pucker" of the lips
essential to the correct pronunciation of the French language.)</p>
      <p><i>"C'est moi, mon ami,"</i> I repeated.</p>
      <p>"The countersign," said the <i>garde</i>.</p>
      <p>"What countersign?" said I, remembering to my consternation
that I had forgotten to secure that important credential.</p>
      <p>The sentry brought his piece to that position which usually
precedes the order "Take aim." I got back a few feet&#8212;the situation was
too close.</p>
      <p><i>"Mon ami,"</i> I ventured to observe, "that ain't the way
we treat noncombatants in America."</p>
      <p>"The countersign," reiterated the <i>garde</i>, still holding
his <i>chassepot</i> in the previous threatening manner.</p>
      <p>I looked up. The stars were in the quiet sky, and the new moon
was just sinking beneath the bold outline of Mount Valerien. The surge
of the Seine against the stone piers of the bridge could be distinctly
heard. The scene was unspeakably tranquil, not to say mournful, and I
said to myself, "Is this a night for assassination?"</p>
      <p>Again I looked up, and I saw the gleam of two more bayonets at
the other end of the bridge. Thereupon I said to myself, "This is not a
night for assassination."</p>
      <p>"The countersign," for the third time, proceeded from the
armed Apollyon in front of me. I grew familiar.</p>
      <p>"Come now, my good friend, this little business of mine
requires some dispatch. During the war in America&#8212;"</p>
      <p>The click of the hammer of the sentry's rifle interrupted me.
I felt uncomfortable. I had been out in the night air many times
before, but I never knew it to be so disagreeably chilly. It climbed in
behind my shirt collar, travelled down my back with a shivering
sensation, and culminated in a regular ague when it reached my knees.
With a terrific effort I calmed myself, and opened on the soldiers
again. "During the war in America&#8212;" There are occasions in a man's
lifetime when the mere fact of his tongue cleaving unexpectedly to the
roof of his mouth is no evidence of cowardice. I had unquestionably
reached that eventful period of my existence, but I also possessed
physical energy to try once more.</p>
      <p>"My good, kind friend, I was going to say that during the war
in America&#8212;"</p>
      <p>"Oh! d&#8212;n your war in America!" roared the sentry, levelling
his rifle full at me.</p>
      <p>There is no American living who would sooner resent an insult
to his native land than myself, and at such a crisis I felt that within
me which might rise at any moment and crush the foul calumniator. But I
reasoned to myself that I would not take the life of this man, now. I
would wait awhile. It was only too evident he was angry, and he might
cool off and apologize. Yes, that was the best course for me to pursue.
Accordingly I ran rapidly over in my mind a little speech, and, turning
to him, spoke thus:</p>
      <p>"Rash, impetuous man&#8212;"</p>
      <p>L A T E R.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the persistent efforts of my dear friend WASHBURNE,
I have just been released from the guard-house after three hideous days
of incarceration. His is a heart that I may truthfully say yearns
toward the unfortunate. I consider him the crowning glory of American
diplomacy in Europe. Language is inadequate to express the feelings of
one who regrets that his sex forbids him to sign himself</p>

      <p><b>NEWSPAPER PERILS.</b></p>
      <p>The local reporter of a Boston daily gives us the following:</p>
      <p>"On Wednesday morning, as the early freight train on the Old
Colony railroad neared the bridge in Quincy, THOMAS ELLIS, a brakeman,
raised up for the purpose of throwing off a bundle of newspapers, when
he was struck by the timbers of the bridge and knocked senseless upon
his car. He wan saved from rolling to the track by TIMOTHY LEE, a paper
boy who was upon the train."</p>
      <p>We are sorry for ELLIS. But he ought to be thankful for one
thing,&#8212;he has a mission. He need not ask, like ANNA DICKINSON: "Why was
I born?" It is all settled that he was "raised up" for the purpose of
throwing off newspapers. Now, although he missed it this time, we have
no doubt he is ordinarily as successful in that line as the most
improved Lightning Press could be. Should he, unfortunately, continue
senseless, PUNCHINELLO suggests that THOMAS devote himself to "throwing
off" editorial articles for the Sun,</p>
      <p>It was very noble in TIMOTHY LEE so promptly to come to the
rescue. But,&#8212;hold! PUNCHINELLO will not be imposed upon: at this moment
are there not grounds for suspecting this "paper boy" to have been
merely a "man of straw"?</p>

      <p><b>A NEW SENSATION WANTED.</b></p>
      <p>The reprehensible haste with which various European nations
terminate their wars is a source of annoyance to every one. Hardly have
we acquired a decided taste for news of some transient war or other,
when the conflicting parties judge that they have had enough of it, and
thus an avenue of enjoyment is summarily closed.</p>
      <p>It is as though one's natural aversion to tomatoes had
gradually changed to liking, and then an untimely autumn frost had
come, to anticipate the gardener and the air-tight can.</p>
      <p>These foreigners are so different from the Americans!</p>
      <p>During the Rebellion&#8212;a comparatively staid and respectable
affair&#8212;a correspondent, after the first two years, became so expert as
to anticipate battles, and knew as much about war as a general. War
news and buckwheat cakes enlivened the matutinal meal. The chances pro
and con gave a zest to conversations else intolerably dull. The war was
an Institution.</p>
      <p>But see how it is in Europe.</p>
      <p>In '66, they spirted away for six weeks and stopped. And now,
after a similar splurge, they have as good as stopped once more. The
correspondents just sent over by our "enterprising" newspapers, are
hardly yet recovered from their sea-sickness. Just as they begin to
sharpen their pencils, presto! the war is over, and the occupation of
these hardy gentlemen is gone.</p>
      <p>Can nothing be done about this? If a protest&#8212;"firm and
dignified"&#8212;would really do no good, what about some <i>new</i>
excitement, which, as every one knows, we <i>must</i> have or perish!
Will no other jealous contiguous nations fall out? Must we fall out
ourselves? Election is still a good way off, and, really, we don't see
what's to be done. Fights are few, and suicides are falling off. The
Indians are disgustingly peaceful, and even the Mormons have subsided.
It is two years and over to the next Presidential election; and there
is no more cholera.</p>
      <p>Really, this is too bad! We must muse on the situation for a
season, and, meanwhile, shall confidently expect something or other to
turn up almost any day.</p>

cat, in Montgomery county. The cat had stolen the note and swallowed
it, was caught and shot, and the note thus recovered."</p>
      <p>There is nothing new in getting notes "from the intestines of
a cat." PAGANINI got no end of notes from catgut. So do VIEUXTEMPS, and
OLE BULL, and TOM BAKER, and others too numerous to mention. The cat
that swallowed the greenback should have been added to BARNUM'S "Happy
Family," however, instead of being sacrificed to Mammon. With its
two-dollar bill it would have been a formidable rival to the <i>Ornithorynchus

      <p>A TREATISE ON THE BANKRUPT LAW, FOR BUSINESS MEN. By AUDLEY W.
GAZZAM, Solicitor in Bankruptcy, Utica, N. Y. New York: GEORGE T.
DELLER, No. 95 Liberty Street.</p>
      <p>This book contains not only all the latest amendments to the
Bankrupt Act, with copious notes covering the latest English and
American decisions, but it also has a prefatory chapter of "Hints to
Persons contemplating Bankruptcy." PUNCHINELLO, feeling a deep interest
in the welfare of <i>The Sun</i>, <i>The Free Press</i>, and certain
others of his contemporaries, earnestly requests their attention to
that chapter. Some such advice as it contains is evidently needed by
them for their guidance through the financial gloom that seems to be
settling on them. The loss of thirty per cent of its circulation within
the past month has brought deep depression upon The Sun. The festive
laugh of its editors &#8212;especially that of the roystering Lothario OLIVER
DYER,&#8212;is but seldom heard, now, in the famed restaurant of MOUQUIN. We
cordially commend to their notice, then, the work in question, that,
availing themselves of its "Hints," they may so arrange as to have
ready, when the smash comes, funds to qualify them for enjoying the
blessed privilege constitutionally granted to all who, like them, have
been "weighed in the balance and found wanting."</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
